#THIS FORK IS NOT MEANT TO BE MERGED WITH THE ORIGINAL BRANCH
Welcome to my personal playground of the *Winter 2019's CSE343 - Operate Group's Project*.
The project is long finished, and since I tried so hard to make the back end as suitable to build upon as possible, the late start of the work on the front end meant that it didn't reach the potential that I think it deserves.
And instead of complaining about it, I have decided to revert to release [v.0.5.0](https://github.com/nevragurses/Software-Devops/releases/tag/v0.5.0), fork it from there, and build the front end in the way I see suitable for it.
I won't by any mean create the perfect idea that was in my head, since our part wasn't the only flop, the entire project in general is hard to build upon.


##How to use?

1- Installation
	* First thing make sure you have [Node.js](nodejs.org) installed
	* If you're installing the project fresh and don't have the `node_modules` directory in the project run `npm i`

2- Usage
	* Getting the server up and running
		* If you just want to run the project execute `npm start` or `node index.js`
		* If you want to use it for development convenience (automatically restarts when editing files) execute `nodemon index.js`
	* Further instructions should be printed in the console
